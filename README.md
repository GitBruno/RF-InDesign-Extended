RF-InDesign-Extended
====================

A framework for customising the menus and context menus in Adobe InDesign by placing script files in a directory structure (and some other stuff, see below).

See the wiki for [installation instructions](https://github.com/ryecroft/RF-InDesign-Extended/wiki#How%20do%20I%20install%20it?)

###What does it do?
By placing script files in a directory structure, you can:
* Create custom [menu-bar menus](https://github.com/ryecroft/RF-InDesign-Extended/wiki/menu-bar-menus).

* Create custom [right-click menus](https://github.com/ryecroft/RF-InDesign-Extended/wiki/right-click-menus) based on the current selection in InDesign.

* Add application-level event handlers (experimental).

* Included in the event handlers is [Correct Layer](https://github.com/ryecroft/RF-InDesign-Extended/wiki/correct-layer) a script that sets the current layer based on your current object style.
* Also included are several useful scripts that we use daily at Rockfax (see [Included Scripts](https://github.com/ryecroft/RF-InDesign-Extended/wiki/included-scripts) for details).
