  // "magic_script_lookup" is used in magic script and the script that decides what to
  // put in the context menu based on the selection.
  // The keys are converted to RegExp (see note below) objects, and matched against a set (no more than
  // one item in a list) of the labels and object styles of the selected objects.
  // To create a match, each of the values seperated by '&&' in the key must match, and if this happens,
  // the value for that key is returned.
  // If you add stuff to this, understand that the first item that matches is chosen,
  // so you should put them in descending order, and because the example that is in there
  // now matches everything, you will need to delete it first.
  
  // If you find you have entries in the menu that won't go away, it's because you've removed
  // them from here. They will be gone after restarting ID, or you can re-add the entry here
  // with a fake key, then pull up the menu again.
