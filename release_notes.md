#Release Notes

You can use this file to inform users of changes to any package you create.

A startup script will open this file if it detects that its last-modified date is after the date it was last shown to the user.

This is disabled on Windows due to some sort of permissions error. The script was unable to save the last opened date to disk, so always opened it.
